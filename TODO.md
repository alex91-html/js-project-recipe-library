### How to demo
See the demo session as an opportunity to get help and feedback from your teammates, as well as getting inspiration from other students' projects.

* When it's your turn, share your screen (try this beforehand so that the tech works)
* Show what you've built, both the result in the browser and the code
* When it comes to the code, focus on a part of the code that you're proud of and explain what it does
* Share what you have learned, what you thought was hard, what you're most proud of and what you would have done differently if you were to start over again
* If during development you found some helpful learning material, don't hesitate to share them
* Prepare what you're going to say and keep it light. Think about your audience and add some context if needed
* Be proud!

**How to listen to a demo**
Listen actively and unmute yourself if you have a question or feedback.
