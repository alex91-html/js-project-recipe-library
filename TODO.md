Good job with your recipe library! Overall you have chosen descriptive function names. Maybe the maxQuotaMessage could be named more ‚Äúfunctiony‚Äù, e.g. displayMaxQuotaMessage, to indicate that it‚Äôs not a regular variable but a function that does something?

Remember to always stick to const as much as you can. Basically you only need to use let if you bump into issues. And remove console.logs. Just a thought about the quota. What would happen if they change the API slightly (i.e. they change the message). Is there a way to handle this error more generic/defensively?

if (data.status === "failed" && data.message.includes("You have reached your daily quota")) { // message
maxQuotaMessage(); return;
}
You can remove the conversation card if you don‚Äôt reeeeally really want to keep it üòá Although, I see now that it kind of works as an error-text box as well so I guess it‚Äôs all good!

However, I think if no filters are matching you should update the DOM and don‚Äôt show any recipes.

PS. I think your card grid would look really good centered.
